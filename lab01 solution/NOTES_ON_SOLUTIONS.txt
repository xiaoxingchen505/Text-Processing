This lab task is sufficiently complicated for us to raise the issue of
how code might be structured/organised.

It's possible to handle this problem with code that could be described
as a "flat script". The file soln_WO_SCRIPT.py is an example of this
type of solution.

An alternative, however, is to use Python's (quite liberal) OOP
facilities to group functionality into more conceptually manageable
blocks as classes. A solution of this kind is available in the file
soln_WO_CLASSES.py
